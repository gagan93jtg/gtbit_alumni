Hello,<br>
Greetings from GTBIT Alumni Network. We started sending out invites from the database we got from college but that database was old and hence we sent invites to those email ids which were given by you at the time of admission. Many people asked us to manually change their email ids. Some students said that email id belonged to their parents, while some lost access to those old ids. We updated our database and got those email ids of batch 2013 - 2017 which are registered with placement cell currently. Hence we are deactivating your account registered with this email id and will send a fresh invitation to your new email id. In case you don't get an invitation on your new email id, drop us an email to admin@gtbitalumni.in.<br><br>

Thanks and regards,<br>
